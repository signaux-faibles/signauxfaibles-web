### Have the project run correctly on Firefox

In order to have the project run correctly on Firefox locally, you need to disable the third-party cookies blocking. To do so, you need to go to the `about:config` page and set the `network.cookie.cookieBehavior` to `0`.

network.cookie.cookieBehavior = 0
```
